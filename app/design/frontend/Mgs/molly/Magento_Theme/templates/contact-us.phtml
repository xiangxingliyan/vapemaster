                        <p>If you received a “Gateway error”, and did not receive an order confirmation email, this may be the result of a declined transaction. A “Gateway Error” indicates that the card used for purchase was declined. Your card may have been declined due to an incorrect billing address entered at the time of checkout (including the name on the card). Please note that the billing information must accurately match the information attached to the card, as any discrepancies will result in a failure to place an order. Additionally, you may verify the billing information on file with your banking institution. If you see a pending charge on your account, it is important to note that this is not an actual charge. Since the card was declined, we were unable to receive any payments from you. Therefore, the pending charge is the result of the card issuer holding the funds from your account that were intended to be used for a purchase. The funds should become re-available to you within 2-3 business days (depending on the processing time of the card issuer). Alternatively, you may contact your banking institution to inquire about expediting the process to release the funds back into your account.</p>
